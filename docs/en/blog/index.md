# TeleFuser Technical Blog

The Technical Blog records how TeleFuser model integrations, engineering architecture, and runtime optimizations are
discovered, implemented, validated, and bounded. Stable user guides describe supported behavior and configuration;
these articles explain the evidence, alternatives, implementation tradeoffs, and applicability behind that behavior.

## Articles

| Date | Article | Status | Validated platform |

## Publication Contract

Each article should include:

1. The engineering question and existing baseline; performance articles should also include the measured bottleneck.
2. Design goals, non-goals, and alternatives considered.
3. The implementation and ownership boundaries.
4. Correctness, parity, stress, and lifecycle validation appropriate to the change.
5. A reproducible environment, command, workload, and acceptance definition.
6. For performance claims, results that separate microbenchmarks, target compute, and end-to-end delivery.
7. Limitations, applicable fallback behavior, and the hardware on which the result was validated.
8. Related work, including close prior art and an explicit statement of what is and is not claimed as novel.

Articles use one of these statuses:

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `experimental` | The implementation or evidence is still incomplete. |
| `validated` | Correctness, documented evidence, and applicable measurements were reproduced on the stated revision and platform. |
| `superseded` | A newer implementation or article replaces the result. |
| `archived` | The implementation no longer applies to the current source tree. |

Performance values are point measurements, not portable guarantees. Every article records its validation revision and
environment so that later changes can be compared without silently treating historical measurements as current
behavior.
